# Cplusplus-Projects

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was for Airgead Banking and needed to display a menu where the user could input the initial investment amount, their monthly deposit, the annual interest, and the number of years the investment will grow. Once this information was put in, two reports needed to be displayed: the first calculating and showing the year end balance and the year end earned interest for each year WITHOUT additional monthly deposits and the second showing the same thing WITH additional monthly deposits.

# What did you do particularly well?
For the project, I felt I problem solved well. My intent was to get assistance from an experienced friend, but circumstances prevented me from doing so, so I had to dig in and really figure out how to get past the roadblocks myself. I feel I did so successfully and am proud of myself for figuring it out.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance my code by verifying that the input received is valid/correct. This would make the code more accurate and allow for the user to put different input in if they, for example, typed letters where an integer needed to be submitted.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I got stuck on how best to get the program to continue from the menu to display the reports. A bit of online research led me to an answer that was extremely easy to implement.
I also found it challenging to figure out the how exactly I wanted to implement the calculations necessary. For this, I wrote out the calculations by hand and then translated that into code.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The biggest skill for me in this project was figuring out what way worked best for me when planning and writing a program. I found that creating a rough outline and then writing and testing a small amount of code at a time helped. Also, just making sure to take my time and think through things. If I would try to rush, I found I would hit a roadblock mentally.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I created seperate files and classes, as well as included inline discriptions of the steps and functions.
